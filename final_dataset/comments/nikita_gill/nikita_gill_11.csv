It has helped me grow and helped me navigate this very painful journey I am on.  I lead a peer support group in my community and many we talk about the things people say to us. Some of the things people say are cruel. What I have found is that our society is not patient with the grieving. My son was buried  on a Friday and I was informed that I was expected to be at work on Monday. If I took off it would be at my expense! Absolute craziness! The truth is when someone loses a child there are no words that are adequate and you can just say that. While someone is grieving , they just want to know that people will just be there if needed. It's so simple but people complicate it with these sayings. Telling young couples at least they are young enough to have more kids is not ok. Telling people that they are in a better place isn't helpful. God seriously did not need another angel, these sayings must stop. They cause pain! Thank you for your writings and poems.

There is no pain that can compare to that of losing a child - so awful to even read that you were asked to come into work on the Monday?!? You’re absolutely right, our society has zero patience for the grieving, there is very much an attitude of discomfort towards those who are mourning deep losses. The worst of it I feel is the attitude of “oh you’re still grieving over that?” as of grief has a time scale. As if such a big loss doesn’t take a lifetime to get over. We really need to learn how to speak more kindly to those who are grieving because we all grieve at some time and having a compassionate language and society for that grief is deeply essential to our well being.
