That some people aren’t meant to be your’s and that some wounds take more than a lifetime to heal.”  —r. m. drake ","Growth is when you look them in the eyes and feel nothing. When what used to hurt you, no longer hurts you. When you pick your shit up and go. And without warnings and without regrets. Always choose your well-being over anything. This is important.  —r. m. drake ",Find the people who root for you. The people who want to watch you succeed. The ones who are really in it for you. Who really care. I can't understand why people choose to chase anyone else. Find the people who support your dreams. Even if some of them are harder to achieve than others. Find the people who want to help. But not only you but others as well. The people who want to spend some of their time helping you heal. Helping you get over your past. Find these people. Choose these people. Love and live by these people. And become this person for someone in need as well. Leave your mark. Your footprint. Something. Anything. To make people remember how beautiful your heart really was.  —r. m. drake ,"""don't let your heart lose hope. the wrong people will exit your life when they have to. and the right ones will find you when you need them the most. trust the process. find comfort in your timing. and let time decide who gets to stay.""  —r. m. drake ",I know you don't like being alone. But you have to stop stressing it. You have to stop forcing things to happen. A new relationship will bloom when you least expect it. You just have to stop trying to control everything. And accept the way things are. And let things happen as they should. At their place. Pace. And time. And when the universe decides you are ready. you will be ready. Amen.  —r. m. drake  ,"It is okay if you do not have the words right now to express what you feel. It is okay if you do not even know what it is you are feeling. It is okay if you don't know where to begin. If you don't know if a chapter in your life has ended. It is okay if you are not sure about your future. Not sure about your past. About what you were thinking. It is okay if you suddenly fell out of love with someone. And especially, if you did not want that to happen but it did. It is okay if you don't know how to apologize. If you are not sure if you even have to. It is okay if you wish to move on. Or even. If you wish to stay where you are a little longer than expected. It is okay to cry. To wake up and cry. And or to fall asleep crying. It is okay to wish you can change things. To wish you can go back and make all the bad things right. It is okay if you are not happy with who you are. At least not for the time being. It is okay to work on yourself. To take as much time as you need, too. until you feel comfortable in your skin. It is okay if you don't feel the same. Don't feel the same about certain things. Like your career aspirations. Certain people. Certain places. Certain things that used to speak to you. It is okay to move away. To find new homes within new people. To find what you love in new places. It is okay. This is your life. And only yours. And life is too short to worry about everything. To overthink about all the details. Because it's okay. And it's going to be okay. Just be yourself. Just take your time.  —tr. m. drake ",Perhaps. The problem is. You overthink too much. And you don't allow yourself to feel what your heart wants to feel.  —r. m. drake ,"Sometimes you give them your heart and they give you shit. And there's nothing you can do about that. It's just, people with the biggest hearts get fucked over the most.  —r. m. drake ","If you want your relationship to last. Then you're going to have to learn a lot about forgiveness. Learn a lot about sacrifice. About sometimes putting what you feel aside in order to make things work. You're going to have to get used to losing every once in a while. Get used to not getting what you want sometimes. Get used to sharing the spotlight. Sharing what's yours. Your mind. Body. And soul. You're going to have to learn how not to be alone all the time. How to share your deepest thoughts and secrets with someone you love. How to be vulnerable. And how to be okay with this change. If you want to make a relationship work, then you must learn about these things. Because these things will make the difference between how much you'll grow together. Between how long it will last.  —R. M. DRAKE ","Conversation is everything. Sometimes that's all you need to pull you out of the darkness. Someone who's willing to listen. Someone who's willing to stay, no matter how late it gets. Deep people with deep hearts and deep thoughts can sometimes save your life. They can sometimes save you from yourself.  —R. M. DRAKE "
