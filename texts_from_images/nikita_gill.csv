"SALT AND SUGAR  The thing is, I still believe in it. The sky during its thunder. The sea during its storm. The earth during its darkest hours. You. Yes you, reading this. I am tired of us abandoning the parts of ourselves we do not like and calling ourselves lost things. The sun does not abandon us when a storm visits. The sea does not abandon the cliffs because they are hardened to her touch. I am asking you not to abandon the parts of yourself that are in need of more love. I am asking you to hold the parts of you that shatter, that scare you, close. I am asking you to become better at loving those portions of yourself you wish to abandon - to learn from them as much as you learn from everything about you that is beloved. The salt as well as  the sugar. The gentle breeze as well as the coarse sand.  Nikita Gill GENTLE REMINDER  The rose is not everyone’s favourite flower, but that does not make it any less beautiful. There is a lesson for all of us in that.  Nikita Gill (Excerp))  I NaMep Us Grier  Perhaps in a different time I would have named us hope.  Perhaps in a different universe we would not meet so battleworn  And I would call us forgiveness, and not remember us as war.  Nikita Gill asons to Live Through the Apocalypse  rises. People you have still to meet and laugh with. uit love, peace, anger, and revolution. Walks in the The smile you exchange with a stranger when you experi beauty accidentally together. Butterflies. Seeing ana ents again. The moon in all her forms, whether half or fall Dore pirthdays and half-birthdays. That feeling of floating in he Watching birds eat from bird feeders. The waves of happiness that follow the end of sadness. Brown eyes. Watching a boat cross an empty sea. Sunsets. Dipping your feet in the river. Balconies. Cake. The wind in your face when you roll the car window down on an open highway. Falling asleep to the sound of a steady heartbeat. Warm cups of tea on cold days. Hugs. Night skies. Art museums. Books filled with everything you do not yet know. Long conversations. Long-lost friends. Poetry.  Songs woods.  Nikita Gill CHILDREN OF GRIEF  Gries firstborn child is Anger. She who storms from room to room, each window rattling in her wake, destruction her middle name and she does not apologise for it. Hurricane in your chest, storm in your soul,  she won’t release you until you shatter.  Grief’s second child 1s Sadness. She who crawls inside your bones and stretches her ivy hands till every part of you 1s constricted inside this web of torment. Tragedy in your bones, decay in your sinews, she will stay until you learn how to use the knife which cuts your way out.  GriePs youngest child is Healing. She who mends broken souls with lacquered gold, each crack glimmering in the sunlight. You will ask her why. Balm for your wounds, gentle rain for your spirit, she will tell  you that what you have loved was never meant to be forgotten.  Nikita Gill Hello, just a reminder that nobody is angry with you, your anxiety is lying to you. If someone is angry with you and they care enough, they will let you know. If they don’t, that’s not on you, that’s their own communication issues. Be peaceful as you go about your day. Tue PrIcE  Ask anyone who walks this Earth, and most will say they Just want a peaceful life. A meal at the table enough to fill a belly. A hug from someone they care for. A warm bed to sleep in. A home filled with love. A lot of laughter and someone to share a drink with. At the end it is the people who pay for the carnage. The mother who must bury her children. The father who never comes back home. The sister who will never know the joy of a shared meal again. The aunt who returns but doesn’t smile anymore. The friends lost along the way. A thousand homes wrecked and a million memories shattered. All because someone else decided to send a war to knock down their door.  Nikita Gill GRIEF IS A | HING WITH FaNncs  Grief is a thing with fangs and it longs to be accepted. I resist it for days before I understand why it stays at my window, begging to be let in. It asks me to put it to bed every night like it is a child, to feed it with my love. It wants a mother so much, because who else could love this painful monster. Who else would kiss its poisonous forehead, its razor sharp hands.  Who else would risk the bleeding. So I do the needful. I give it the nurture it begs for. I nourish it, trusting that like any good monster, one day when it has fed enough it may leave. I build it a room in my heart and learn how to live with it. Everything feels like a wound between these four small walls but there is nowhere else I will heal.  Nikita Gill REINCARNATION (Excerpt)  Before we had mouths or language or hope, we still had love. I know it’s not much. But my God, it’s beautiful and on so many days  it 1s enough.  Nikita Gill Normalise grief as an emotion that demands to be felt the same way love  and hope and joy are. "
