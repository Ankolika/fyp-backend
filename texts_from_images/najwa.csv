"The one in charge of letting go of the pain inflicted on you is you. Not anyone else. I guarantee that even if the person who hurt you came back to you right now and admitted what they did and said they regret it, it will not take away the pain. It might for a little bit. But that’s just a patch, a Band-Aid.  Someone can’t be the pain and the cure at the same time. -Najwa Zebian ","It hurts because they meant something to you. It hurts because you believed them. It hurts because you saw a future with them. Because you were vulnerable with them, because you spent so much of your time and energy on them. Of course that’s going to hurt. So it’s okay for it to hurt. Let it. Sit with the pain. This should never be your normal. You should never be okay with being treated badly. You should never be okay with being betrayed. You should never be okay with having someone you trusted so much turn around and treat you as if you never meant anything to them. You should never be okay with that. -Najwa Zebian ","I think it’s beautiful how you see the best in people. And how you mine for the light in the darkest moments. I think it’s beautiful how you put others inside your eyes so they can see themselves the way you see them. And how you love so purely and feel so deeply. I think it’s beautiful how you still run like a child into the hearts of the ones you love. And how you love like you’ve never been hurt before. And just like I think it’s beautiful that you are the way you are with the ones you love, I think it would be even more beautiful for you to be the way you are with yourself. You deserve it. It’s time.  -Najwa Zebian ","228 WELCOME HOME  weweme waume the course oe ce few ce ete SE MEME geMg Fak te er ae are grr em ee Who  Remembe: when | sald wan |) ee eg te dee of ee woman } wo ceeeeeed | qumdied ce Geo Oe Gage fe tee | Walk  wh ae te eT WEF career curring Re deme td) women @ Ge hee aagit feteer a carte ee of ie fm mer!) ep ce hGimamom. | war stig om Me cath eer Geen GH wot! living room teeteng lime < Hite Geet Semel Me mee wie!

Admitting you have work: do on yourself is important. Admitting there are people you nee to let go of is important. Admitting you could have done better witl what you knew is important. Admitting you’re consciously blindin; yourself to a positive emotion that’s at your door is important. It’ not weakness. It’s courage. And the origin of courage is the Latin word cor, which means “heart, as the seat of emotions.”  How beautiful is it to think that the act of courage, of showi this heart of yours, requires you to expose yourself emotionally? To unveil? To be vulnerable? To be open to injury? Many of us fo t too much on that injury part. What if we said that just as you are opening yourself up to injury, you are also opening yourself  ","ME: I think I wanted to be held on to by him, but not the way he was holding on to me, which implies I wanted to change the way he feels, And I have no power to do that. -Najwa Zebian —_———————L——S ",Never wish them pain. That’s not who you are. If they caused you pain they must have pain inside. Wish them healing.  Najwa Zebian ,,"Once | built a home within myself, all the other homes I'd built in others became memories of all the places I never want to visit again. A home that only welcomes you when you abandon yourself is not a home. It’s a prison.  - Najwa Zebian ","<e Najwa Zebian updated her status. eee Feb 26, 2017 - London - &  This is a reminder to anyone who has been deeply broken to the point where they feel that there is absolutely no way to heal. The harder it feels that it is to heal yourself, that just means that what you went through was that painful. The harder it is that you fell, the more time it's going to take you to get back up. The more broken you were, the more time it's going to take for you to put your broken pieces back together. So the depth of your pain shows the depth of your struggle. And the depth of your struggle shows the depth of your endurance. And the depth of your endurance is going to show how much of the hero you are, and how much of a hero you are going to be. So as tempting as it may be to give up and say, ""I'm never going to get over it"", you ARE going to get over it. Because if you went through that kind of pain and you survived, you're going to become such a beautiful person. You already are. And you're becoming even more beautiful. "
